There once was a charitable man named Richard Corey. He was kind, gave to charity, and was an upstanding man... but I hated him. *I worked in his factory.*

I did ever so wish that I could *be* Richard Corey. To enjoy the things that he did, drinking wine and dancing late into the evening.

*He must be so happy*, I thought to myself.

...so imagine my shock when I heard he had gotten home last night, and shot himself in the head.

He may have been as unhappy as I.
