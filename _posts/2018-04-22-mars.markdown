**Death on Mars** discusses the evidence pointing to the annihilation of an ancient and advanced society on Mars. This theory connects the dots between a number of facts about the geology and atomic composition of the Red Planet.

### The Following Evidence is Presented:
1. The presence of (what seem to be) fabricated structures on the planet. Pyramids, faces, city ruins.
2. Radioactive isotopes distributed on the surface of Mars.
3. Ancient signs of water on mars.

This catastrophe, and the potential presence of a greater spacefaring species provides a solid resolution to the *Fermi Paradox*, which is as follows:

*"The Fermi paradox, or Fermi's paradox, named after physicist Enrico Fermi, is the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence and high probability estimates for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations."[^1]*
